    "## Results: \n",
    "- **After filtering** the data for rows where the **total_votes** count is *greater or equal 20*:\n",
    "    - There were a total of 27389 reviews\n",
    "    - 12371 of the total reviews were 5-star reviews\n",
    "    - 202 of the five-star reviews were vine (paid) reviews\n",
    "    - 12033 of the five-star reviews were non-vine (unpaid) reviews\n",

    "## Summary: \n",
    "The number of 5-star reviews from the vine program constitutes about 1.6% of the total five-star reviews. Based on this result I conclude that the paid vine progam has *no postive bias* in product reviews."
